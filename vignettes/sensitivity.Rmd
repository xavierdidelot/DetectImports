In this vignette we test the sensitivity of the method by simulating with imports and making sure that they are found.

# Initialisation

```{r}
library(DetectImports)
library(ape)
set.seed(0)
```

# Simulation with a single import

Let's consider that the local population started in 2020 and a single import occurred in 2020.5.
1000 genomes were sampled between 2020 and 2021.

```{r}
tree=simImports(localPopStart=2020,importDates=c(2020.5),
                samplingStartDate=2020,samplingEndDate=2021,samplingNumber=1000)
plot(tree,show.tip.label = F)
axisPhylo(backward = F)
```

Let's detect the imports:

```{r}
pvals=test1(tree)
```

The real imports were:
```{r}
tree$imports
```

The inferred imports were:
```{r}
which(pvals<0.05)
```

# Simulation with two imports

Let's consider that the local population started in 2020 and a two imports occurred in 2020.25 and 2020.5.
1000 genomes were sampled between 2020 and 2021.

```{r}
tree=simImports(localPopStart=2020,importDates=c(2020.25,2020.5),
                samplingStartDate=2020,samplingEndDate=2021,samplingNumber=1000)
plot(tree,show.tip.label = F)
axisPhylo(backward = F)
```

Let's detect the imports:

```{r}
pvals=test1(tree)
```

The real imports were:
```{r}
tree$imports
plotImports(tree,tree$imports)
```

```{r}

```

The inferred imports were:
```{r}
which(pvals<0.05)
plotImports(tree,which(pvals<0.05))
```
