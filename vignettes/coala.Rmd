In this vignette we test the method on trees simulated using the `coala` package.

# Initialisation

```{r}
library(DetectImports)
library(ape)
library(coala)
```

# Simulating two populations

Let's consider that the local population started in 2020 and a single import occurred in 2020.5.
1000 genomes were sampled between 2020 and 2021.

```{r}
simulateAndPlotComparison(pop1_sample_size = 10, rate=0.5, divergence.time = 5, seed=20)
```
